# Hypothyroidism-Prediction
## a) Specifying the Question
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. As a data scientist i have been tasked to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## b) Defining the Metric for Success
This project will be successful when:

1)We Identify the most crucial independent variables that affect Hypothyroidism.

2)The model achieves atleast 90% accuracy

3)Have the lowest RMSE score possible

## c) Understanding the context
Hypothyrodism is a condition where the body produces too little thyroxine. Low thyroxine levels cause problems with development if it occurs when an individual is young. In adults, thyroxine deficiency will lower the metabolic rate, causing weight gain, memory problems, infertility, fatigue, and muscle stiffness.

Thyroxine: is a hormone secreted in the thyroid glands into the bloodstream. It plays a crucial role in heart and digestive function, metabolism, brain development, bone health, and muscle control. It affects almost all of the body's systems, which means proper thyroxine levels are vital for health.
